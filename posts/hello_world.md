<!--first post - hello world! - with code examples-->
This is my first blog post!

I don't know where to start, So I'm gonna try starting with how everyone in the CS world would begin, by saying `Hello World!` in languages I'm trying to learn and be proficient in.

**Python**
```python
print('Hello world!')
```
**Javascript**
```javascript
console.log('Hello World!')
```

Ok, here a goes me wasting an hour to find an xkcd comic
